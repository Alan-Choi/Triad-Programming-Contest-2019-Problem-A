# A.  Reading Backwards
 
Write program that will display the words of a text file in reverse order.  The first word of the input file should be the last word of the output and the last word in the input file should be the first word displayed.  The characters of a word should not be reordered.  Punctuation (the characters period and comma), if they occur, must be displayed in the beginning of a word instead of at the end as is normally done.  The end of the text will be a star,”*” preceded by a space.  The words must be output with a single space between them.  There will be no more than 1000 words in the input file, text.txt
